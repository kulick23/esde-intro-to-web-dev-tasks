## How to run

### Running by simply opening index.html in browser

- Open file index.html in browser
  - In Visual Studio Code right click in index.html -> Copy Path
  - Open browser and paste copied path as an url (i.e `D://Proejcts/intro-to-web-dev-tasks/packages/classtask-YuliaVorman/index.html`)
- Enjoy

Why not to use that approach - every time you're making changes you have to reload your page manually

Why to use - simply you don't want to deal with NPM and JavaScript or there might be any issues currently with it

### Running using NPM and JavaScript (Preferred)

- Open console
- In console navigate to the project root (`./intro-to-web-dev-tasks`)
- Run `npm install`
- Navigate to the project `cd packages/classtask-YuliaVorman`
- Run `npm run serve`
- Open browser
- Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`
- Enjoy

Why to use - every time you make a change your page is automatically reloaded and your changes applied
